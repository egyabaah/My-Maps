## *Emmanuel Gyabaah*

**My Maps** displays a list of maps, each of which show user-defined markers with a title, description, and location. The user can also create a new map, change map type and search for maps. 

Time spent: **7.5** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The list of map titles is displayed.
* [x] After tapping on a map title, the associated markers in the map are shown.
* [x] The user is able to create a new map.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] When a map marker is created, the pin is animated.
* [x] In the initial screen, show the number of places in each map along with the title.
* [x] Instead of the default marker, use a custom marker drawable.
* [x] Add a menu option in the map activity to change the map type (e.g. normal vs terrain)
* [x] In the creation flow, add a button where the map will move to the userâ€™s current location.
* [x] Add the ability to search for maps which contain a string in the title.

## Notes
TODO: Replace file storage with database later

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* UI wasn't updating list of map tiles being displayed after implementing Filterable interface hence I had to rewrite a new RecycleView Adapter logic to extend ListAdapter (https://stackoverflow.com/a/69527742/25119769)
